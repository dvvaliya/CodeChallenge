Quick tips for understanding structure and editing in codebase:
1. CodeChallege codebase structure is like CodeChallenge-> src-> assets, components, navigations, screens, styles & utilities.
2. assets folder consist of two folders: Fonts & Images 
a. Add all fonts in Fonts folder and make sure it has .ttf extension file.
b. Add all images in Images folder to used them in the app.
3. components folder consits of frequently used components so we can reuse them anywhere in the app.
   * a. Right now components consist of two folders: Home & Post.
   * b. Home folder consits of three components which we are using in Home screen named as HomeUserStory.js for showing top most list of Home screen, Category.js       for displaying category type and HomeRecipeList for main list of recipe in Home screen.
   * c. Post folder consist of two components named as CookingDurationSlider.js which we are using in Post screen for sliding values for cooking duration and PostTextInput.js which we are usinh for TextInput like recipe name & Description.
   * Note: In Above any components you can make any changes to reflect them in all screens wherever we are using that components.
4. navigations folder contain main Navigator.js file which we are using to assign bottom tabs and any screen we need them in stack that should be put in this class.
5. screens folder is the main folder where we have all the screens folder like Home, Post, Search, Notifications & Profile.
   * a. Home folder consist the Home.js which we are using for rendering Home screen UI.
   * b. Post folder consist the Post.js & Pic.js, while Post.js are using for rendering Post screen UI & Pic.js are using for custom laytout of camera overlay.
6. styles folder consist of Style.js in that we are declaring all the styles of the app at one place, so we can reuse any styles as we want.
7. utilities folder consist of Colors.js, Constant.js & Images.js, while Colors.js are using for all colors which we are using in the app and Constant.js are declaring all static values at one place and Images.js are using for declaring all static images which we are using in the app so similar images we use use without reassign them.

P.s. For better experience of camera and UI of the app try to run on Real android device via debugging or on iOS Simulator.
